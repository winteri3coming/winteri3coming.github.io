      <description>Summary Today we&amp;rsquo;re doing Busqueda from Hack The Box. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be an easy machine but, for me i think it&amp;rsquo;s much more of a medium one. The web server on this box is based on Flask (Python), and while these tend to be vulnerable to SSTI and code execution, it was a bit hard to craft the right payload, after getting a foothold on the box, User was straight forward, Root has many misleading routes, but with a good wide enumeration, you&amp;rsquo;ll find your way in.</description>
